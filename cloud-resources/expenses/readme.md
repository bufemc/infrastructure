# Expenses

After spiking costs due to increased public interest in [direkt.bahn.guru](https://github.com/juliuste/direkt.bahn.guru), I ([@juliuste](https://github.com/juliuste)) started a [Github Sponsors](https://github/sponsors/juliuste) page in May 2022, collecting donations to partially offset the operational costs, which were fully covered from private funds before.

To provide transparency regarding the usage of these donations, I will henceforth document income and expenses on this page. Note that as long as the donations don't fully offset all infrastructure costs, the list of expenses might be incomplete (the income will always be fully documented, however).

**_Furthermore, I want to thank all sponsors for supporting our projects! Unfortunately, most of the time, I don't have email contacts to thank you personally, so feel free to reach out to me with contact information._**

## May 2022

### Remarks

- [@juliuste](https://github.com/juliuste) started a [Github Sponsors](https://github/sponsors/juliuste) page to collect donations
- Increased public interest (probably related to Germany's [_9 euro ticket_](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-Euro-Ticket)) resulted in a spike of operational costs for [direkt.bahn.guru](https://github.com/juliuste/direkt.bahn.guru), especially for map tile hosting. Mapbox provides the first 50k map initializations for free, and usually the service stays within that limit, but this month the service caused more than 250k inits. After contacting mapbox support, they kindly provided a 90% discount for our project, however still resulting in very high costs for this month (which are luckily offset by high one-time donations also resulting from the increased interest in the service).

## June 2022

### Remarks

- Continued spike in public interest for [direkt.bahn.guru](https://github.com/juliuste/direkt.bahn.guru), resulting in higher operational costs, especially for map tile hosting, but also higher amount of one-time donations, helping to offset last month's deficit
- Moved from Scaleway RDS to self-hosted (because HA isn't important for our current use case), reducing server costs

### Remarks

- Continued spike in public interest for [direkt.bahn.guru](https://github.com/juliuste/direkt.bahn.guru), resulting in higher operational costs, especially for map tile hosting, but also higher amount of one-time donations, helping to offset previous months' deficits
- Fixed a bug in [public-transport-data-scraper](https://github.com/juliuste/public-transport-data-scraper) and removed some duplicate datasets caused by that bug from our S3 bucket, leading to (slightly) reduced costs for DigitalOcean S3 (full effect should be visible next month)
