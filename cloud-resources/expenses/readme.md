# Expenses

After spiking costs due to increased public interest in [direkt.bahn.guru](https://github.com/juliuste/direkt.bahn.guru), I ([@juliuste](https://github.com/juliuste)) started a [Github Sponsors](https://github/sponsors/juliuste) page in May 2022, collecting donations to partially offset the operational costs, which were fully covered from private funds before.

To provide transparency regarding the usage of these donations, I will henceforth document income and expenses on this page. Note that as long as the donations don't fully offset all infrastructure costs, the list of expenses might be incomplete (the income will always be fully documented, however).

**_Furthermore, I want to thank all sponsors for supporting our projects! Unfortunately, most of the time, I don't have email contacts to thank you personally, so feel free to reach out to me with contact information._**
