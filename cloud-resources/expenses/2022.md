# 2022 expenses and donations

## May 2022

### Remarks

- [@juliuste](https://github.com/juliuste) started a [Github Sponsors](https://github/sponsors/juliuste) page to collect donations
- Increased public interest (probably related to Germany's [_9 euro ticket_](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/9-Euro-Ticket)) resulted in a spike of operational costs for [direkt.bahn.guru](https://github.com/juliuste/direkt.bahn.guru), especially for map tile hosting. Mapbox provides the first 50k map initializations for free, and usually the service stays within that limit, but this month the service caused more than 250k inits. After contacting mapbox support, they kindly provided a 90% discount for our project, however still resulting in very high costs for this month (which are luckily offset by high one-time donations also resulting from the increased interest in the service).
