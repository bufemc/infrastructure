# infrastructure

This repository defines our shared cloud infrastructure as well as the applications running on it. Following the ideas of *[Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code)* and *[GitOps](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-gitops)*, all changes to the setup are introduced through pull requests and applied automatically after merging.

## Cloud infrastructure

We use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to manage our cloud infrastructure (things such as servers, S3 buckets, databases, managed kubernetes, etc.). Check the [docs in `/cloud-resources`](./cloud-resources/) for details.

## Applications

We use [Kubernetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubernetes) to run most of our applications. Check the docs in [docs in `/kubernetes`](./kubernetes/) for details.

## (How) Can I deploy my apps here?

You're invited to deploy your FOSS apps on our infrastructure, under the preconditions that you commit to our [code of conduct](./code-of-conduct.md) and that your apps' resource requirements aren't too demanding.

Furthermore, hosting someone else's software always mandates a certain level of trust, so these conditions should not be seen as fully exhaustive.

**You can find a step-by-step guide for deploying new apps on our cluster [here](./kubernetes/#how-can-i-deploy-my-own-app), and feel free to ask for help at any time! ðŸ™‚**
